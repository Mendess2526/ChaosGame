# ChaosGame

This small project is inspired by the numberphile [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs) where they go over patterns created from randomness.

After running the program just use the number keys to change the number of anchor points and the arrow keys to change between mid-point jumps, third of the way jumps, etc.
